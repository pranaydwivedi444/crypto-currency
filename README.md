- **Live Trading Values:** The app provides real-time trading values for various cryptocurrencies. Users can see the current traded value per coin.

- **24-hour Change:** The app tracks the net rise/fall of each cryptocurrency over the past 24 hours and displays it with an appropriate color (green for rise and red for fall).

- **7-day Change:** The app also tracks the net rise/fall of each cryptocurrency over the past 7 days and displays it with an appropriate color (green for rise and red for fall).

- **Logo of Coin:** The app displays the logo of each cryptocurrency along with its name and current trading value.

- **Pagination:** The app uses pagination to make it easy for users to navigate through the list of cryptocurrencies.

- **Cryptocurrency Conversion:** The app also allows users to convert one cryptocurrency to another. Users can select the cryptocurrency they want to convert from, enter the amount they want to convert, and select the cryptocurrency they want to convert to. The app will then display the conversion rate and the converted value.
